# Introduction to the Quality Assurance Framework for Data Linkage (QAFDL)

## Purpose of QAFDL

It acts as a guide designed to provide a structured approach to managing and assuring the quality of data linkage processes in NHS England. It is a framework not a policy and therefore it is not prescriptive; it is rather a guiding tool that outlines best practices, principles, and strategies to facilitate high-quality data linkage. It aims at enhancing data quality, promoting transparency, safety and ultimately improving the value derived from linked data.

It is aimed at:

- Data Linkers, those doing data linkage.

- Users of linked data, those carrying out research or analysis using data linkage.

The QAFDL acts as a guide for data linkers by setting out quality dimensions that needs to be considered on any data linkage project. This aids in maintaining consistency across projects, as those dimensions will provide a holistic view of what quality looks like when doing data linkage therefore improving the quality of the data linked. It offers guidance for each step of the process, from preparing and matching data to evaluating the quality of the links. Additionally, it serves as a useful training tool, offering an overview of the data linkage process to educate new staff and support more experienced data linkers.

The QAFDL is based on three principles, linkage quality, transparency and safety. It can help boosting users' trust in the validity of the linked data for their analysis or research. It guides linkers and users on managing and interpreting linked data effectively, providing insights into the limitations of their linked data assets, enabling well-informed decisions and robust analyses. Moreover, the QAFDL promotes ethical and responsible use of linked data by suggesting best practices for data privacy and governance.

The Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR) published their report [Joining up data for better statistics](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/joining-up-data/), This report investigates capability of the the UK statistical system to provide greater insights to users via linked data. OSR provides useful guidance about [what a safe and effective data linkage system looks like](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Data-linking-v11-poster.pdf). This framework aims to cover all those suggestions plus offering specific guidance to achieve it.

## Definition of data linkage

Data linkage refers to the process of connecting different datasets to create a more comprehensive view of an entity. An entity can be a patient, events, organisations, etc.

Data linkage is essential for healthcare research, statistics, and direct care, as it enables seamless integration of information and greatly impacting the quality of healthcare outcomes.

## Benefits of data linkage

The NHS, as stated on the [Long Term Plan](https://www.longtermplan.nhs.uk/), aims to use data more effectively across health and social care services, for both individual care and for planning and research purposes and this can be done through data linkage. Other benefits are:

- **Enhanced Insights:** By combining data from different data sources, more in-depth information can be learnt about specific people, groups of people, or occurrences. Linkage also helps policy makers in the development, and evaluation of policies and programmes.

- **Longitudinal Analysis and research opportunities:** Data linkage makes it possible to follow people over time, enabling longitudinal research that can more accurately highlight trends and patterns. Also, opens new possibilities for research that would not be feasible with isolated datasets.

- **Risk Management:** By spotting trends and correlations that might otherwise go unnoticed in isolated datasets, linked data can help organisations foresee and address possible problems.

- **Reduced burden in providers:** Data linkage reduces the need to collect the same information multiple times, thereby reducing the burden on providers. Data linkage can also reduce costs associated with duplicate efforts in data collection.

- **Improved Data Quality:** By facilitating the comparison of data across many sources, linkage enables the identification and correction of discrepancies or errors.

- **Reducing Bias:** When data from different sources is linked, it can help reduce selection bias in research studies, leading to more reliable findings.

- **Service Delivery:** In healthcare and social services, data linkage can improve service delivery by providing a more holistic view of a person's needs and interactions with different services.
