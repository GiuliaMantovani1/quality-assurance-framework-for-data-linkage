# Other considerations

## Information governance

Good governance is vital for public confidence. When it comes to data linkage, this implies strict controls over who can access data, for what purposes, and under what conditions. It also involves transparency about these controls and about how privacy is protected. Information governance sets standards and guidelines for data handling, promoting consistency, accountability, and compliance. By having a unified approach to data management, organizations can mitigate risks and ensure the effective utilization of data resources. Everyone within the organization understands their responsibilities and adheres to the same standards when it comes to handling data.

## Secure data storage and access

Above all, the confidentiality of individuals and their information must be protected. Security measures should be in place to protect sensitive information. There are measures in place to ensure the security and protection of the data. There was a review process oto weight the potential public benefits of linking the data against the risks to privacy. This is fundamental to generate public trust.

- **Secure data storage and access:** Before linking datasets, steps may need to be taken to protect the privacy of individuals. This could involve anonymizing or de-identifying the data, or applying privacy-preserving data linkage methods. A data sharing agreement (DSA) is in place.

- **Security:** Combining sensitive data from different sources can risk disclosing data The linkage of records does not disclose sensitive information that hasn’t been agreed on the DSAs or DPIAs. If not managed properly, this could lead to negative impacts such as reputational damage, loss of customer trust, or legal penalties. Assess the potential risks and ensure that appropriate data protection measures are in place.

- **Confidentiality and data security:** This aspect is critically important in data linkage, as it often involves combining sensitive data from different sources. It would be essential to have strict procedures and safeguards in place to protect individuals' privacy and prevent any unauthorized access to or misuse of the data. It also involves being transparent about how personal data is protected and how privacy is maintained when linking data.
