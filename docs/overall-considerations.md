# Overall considerations

## Uncertainty management

Addressing uncertainty in the Data Linkage process enhances confidence in its outcomes.

Transparent communication of risks, assumptions, and dependencies is essential, alongside periodic reassessment of these factors.

!!! info "Uncertainty management"

    === "Recommendations"

        Three key aspects require consideration:

        - Risks: Risks pertain to potential events that may adversely affect project objectives, outcomes, or schedules. Managing risks entails identifying, evaluating, prioritising, and mitigating them to safeguard project success.

        - Assumptions: These are accepted beliefs on which the Data Linkage model relies. Managing assumptions involves acknowledging, documenting, and validating these beliefs.

        - Dependencies: Interdependencies among project components may exist. Managing dependencies entails identifying and monitoring these relationships and proactively addressing them during the planning phase.


    === "RAG"  

        &#128308; **RED:** <br>
        Uncertainties are not recognised, managed or communicated.

        &#128993; **AMBER:** <br>
        Some uncertainties are recognised, but the communication and management process could be improved.

        &#128994; **GREEN:** <br>
        Uncertainties are comprehensively recognised, managed and communicated.

## Communication of changes

Communication of Changes involves clearly and effectively sharing updates or modifications to core data linkage algorithms or methodologies.

        &#128993; **AMBER:** <br>
        Partial roadmap for changes and non-timely engagement with stakeholders lead to changes being introduced poor notification.

        &#128994; **GREEN:** <br>
        Presence of a roadmap for changes and effective engagement with stakeholders ensure changes are introduced with proper notification.

## Safety

Data Linkage must occur in a safe environments and be a regulated process.

!!! info "Safety"

    === "Recommendations"

        - Regulations: Adhere to data protection regulations like GDPR and the Data Protection Act 2018. Supporting documents like Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) and Data Sharing Agreements (DSAs) should demonstrate compliance.

        - Data minimisation: Separate personal identifiable information and clinical outcomes and ensure linked records don't reveal sensitive information beyond what's been agreed upon. Consider using Privacy Enhancing Techniques (PETs) to protect individual privacy (for example, encryption)


    === "RAG"
        &#128308; **RED:** <br>
        Data regulations and data minimisation principles are not followed. Unwanted disclosive information might be released.

        &#128993; **AMBER:** <br>
        Partial adherence to data regulations and data minimisation principles. Some risk of disclosive information been released exists.

        &#128994; **GREEN:** <br>
        Data regulations and data minimisation principles are followed comprehensively.



## Ethics and fairness

Ethical principles should guide every stage of the Data Linkage process.

!!! info "Ethics and fairness"

    === "Recommendations"

        - Fairness: Ensuring that the project and its outcomes are non-discriminatory. Identifying issues such as bias or uneven error distribution among different population segments.

        - Accountability: Ensuring that individuals in the Data Linkage workflow are accountable for the decisions made at each stage.

        - Sustainability: Ensuring that the Data Linkage model remains relevant as real-world data evolve over time.

        - Transparency: Offering clear access to processes and decisions.


    === "RAG"
        &#128308; **RED:** <br>
        No ethical considerations are made. Possible risks of bias or misuse of data are unaddressed.

        &#128993; **AMBER:** <br>
        Some ethical considerations, but without thorough implementation or follow-through. Risks of hidden bias or misuse of data may still exist.

        &#128994; **GREEN:** <br>
        Comprehensive ethical considerations. Risks are understood and disclosed.

## Information governance

Data linkage projects need clear structure and accountability. Defining roles, assigning ownership, and implementing strong oversight lets organisations manage complex Data Linkage projects while ensuring a high standard of information governance.

!!! info "Information governance"

    === "Recommendations"

        - Roles: Clearly define and document key roles like Information Asset Owner (IAO) and Data Linkage Owner (DLO).

        - Responsibilities: DLO is responsible for ensuring projects align with Quality Assurance Framework principles.


    === "RAG"

        &#128308; **RED:** <br>
