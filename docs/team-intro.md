# Data Linkage Hub at NHS England

The Data Linkage Hub's work remit encompasses all things data linkage, from documenting the existing [state of linkage in NHS England in the Person_ID handbook](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/personal-demographics-service/master-person-service/the-person_id-handbook), to exploring better matching algorithms using probabilistic models and [Splink](https://github.com/moj-analytical-services/splink), to creating a Quality Assurance Framework for Data Linkage.

Data Linkage is a business-critical process within many government organisations, including NHS England. Being able to link patients across their care journey, making sure that under-represented populations are not lost in the cracks, and ensuring compatibility when using several data sets for the same purpose is a pillar of why the Data Linkage Enhancement team exists.

## Data Linkage Enhancement Vision

The vision for the Data Linkage Hub is to become a key driver in enhancing patient health, directly or indirectly, by establishing a centre of excellence in quality and consistent data linkage practices.

The hub aims to:

1. Implement ethical and high-quality data linkage practices.
2. Enforce these practices in collaboration with the broader data and analytics community in NHS England and beyond.
3. Facilitate easier integration across departments.
4. Develop comprehensive solutions that consider all stakeholders.
5. Promote continuous improvement and adaptation to new or changing requirements.

## Work we do

### Quality Assurance Framework

If we want to achieve a consistent and high quality approach to linking data, which allows for robust, transparent and auditable results, we also need a framework to operate within. Hence, this workstream aims at creating, testing and implementing in the business process a Quality Assurance Framework for Data Linkage.

### Better Matching Algorithm

We're currently working on implementing a probabilistic linkage model using Splink, in order to improve linkage outcomes, and by extension, patient outcomes.

### Data Linkage as a service

This is the umbrella covering everything else we do. This stream of work encompasses:

- Identifying points of collaboration with other government departments
- Mapping the stakeholders involved in data linkage - both internal and external
- Feeding user needs into an overall Data Linkage vision
