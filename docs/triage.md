## Determining the level of linkage quality assurance

Different data linkage projects require varying levels of assurance depending on resource, profile, risk considerations, and time constraints.

!!! info "Type: Process"

    === "Prescriptive"

        - Assess the resource availability, project profile, risk considerations, impact and timeline constraints to determine the appropriate level of quality assurance for the data linkage project.

        - Consider the complexity and sensitivity of the data being linked to gauge the required level of assurance.

        - Define a clear quality assurance pathway where the relevant quality dimensions are assigned to different parts of the business or teams.

    === "RAG"

        **RED** :red_circle:<br>
        No level of quality assurance has been determined.

        **AMBER** :yellow_circle:<br>
        The level has been determined, but not consistent according to project needs.

        **GREEN** :green_circle:<br>
        The level of quality assurance has been determined and is deemed appropriate to the linkage project.

    === "Example"

## User requirement

User Requirement refers to the process of clearly understanding and documenting the scope of deliverables in a Data Linkage project. It involves specifying the required data and sources, purpose and objectives, output specifications, timelines, data security measures, and compliance with legal and ethical guidelines. The goal is to have a comprehensive understanding of the user's needs and expectations.

!!! info "Type: Process"

    === "Prescriptive"

        - Engage with data linkage users to understand their specific data linkage needs and objectives.

        - Clearly document the scope of deliverables, including data sources, purpose, output specifications, timelines, data security measures, and compliance with legal and ethical guidelines.

        - Maintain open communication channels with users to address any concerns or changes in requirements throughout the project.

        - Provide evidence of user requirement understanding and agreement to ensure alignment and avoid misinterpretation.

    === "RAG"

        **RED** :red_circle:<br>
        User requirements are not clearly understood or addressed. Scope of deliverables, data and sources, timelines, and ethical/legal guidelines are unspecified or unclear.

        **AMBER** :yellow_circle:<br>
        Some user requirements are understood and addressed, but evidence for this may be inconsistent. Some elements like output specifications, timelines, or compliance may be unclear.

        **GREEN** :green_circle:<br>
        Detailed understanding of user requirements with clear evidence. All elements, including data and sources, purpose and objectives, output specifications, timelines, and ethical/legal compliance are well-defined and addressed.

    === "Example"

## Resourcing and skills

This dimension focuses on ensuring that the data linkage project team has the necessary resources and skills to successfully complete the project within the designated timeframe. It involves assessing and providing appropriate resources. Additionally, it ensures that the team has the required expertise and capabilities to execute the project effectively.

!!! info "Type: Process"

    === "Prescriptive"

        - Ensure resources, including personnel, technology, and infrastructure, are adequate and available for the data linkage project.

        - Identify and acquire the necessary skills and expertise within the linkers.

        - Allocate appropriate time and budget for training and skill development, if required, to enhance the organisationâ€™s capabilities.

    === "RAG"

        **RED** :red_circle:<br>
        Insufficient resources and skills in the team to deliver the data linkage project on time. Deliverables often delayed or of sub-par quality.

        **AMBER** :yellow_circle:<br>
        The team has some resources and skills, but may struggle with certain aspects of the project or meet the required timescales consistently.

        **GREEN** :green_circle:<br>
        The team is adequately resourced and skilled, capable of delivering the data linkage project within the required timescale and to a high standard.
